# Computer age statistical inference

.heatinline[Context is king in statistics]

- Financial datasets used to solve modern investment problems offer unique challenges which are beyond many *plug and play* data science algorithms. 

--

- The era of "Big Data" has provided a backdrop for the rapid expansion of immense computer-based processing algorithms, for instance, random forest for prediction. 

--

- The importance of inferential arguments in support of the ML applications has emerged as an exciting (yet underdeveloped) field.  

--

- This is particularly true for financial research questions where the complexity of the **data story** (or more formally the data generating process which underpins the sample) result in notoriously noise covariance matrices.  

--

- A small percentage of information these matrices contain is *signal*, which is systemically suppressed by arbitrage forces. 

--

- This course will introduce best practice techniques in financial data science which can help illicit economically meaningful *signal* and answer contemporary financial research questions.

# Big Data - Big Compute in Finance
### Exponential growth in machine readable data to record and communicate activities in the financial system

- IBM has estimated that 90% of the world's data ssets have been created in the last 2 years.
- [IMB estimate by 2020 there will be 44 zettabytes (44 trillion gigabytes) created, 300 times the amount in 2005](https://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/sites/default/files/infographic_file/4-Vs-of-big-data.jpg?cm_mc_uid=16172304396014932905991&amp;cm_mc_sid_50200000=1494235431&amp;cm_mc_sid_52640000=1494235431).

### Persistent growth in computer power

[&lt;img src='img/2sigma.png' width="80px",align="center"\&gt;](https://www.twosigma.com/) Hedge-fund firm Two Sigma has built a computing sysetem with more than 100 teraflops of power, which is 100 trillion calculations per second

# Why study FML?
- .large[Classical econometrics fails on these *Big* datasets]

- .large[Linear algebra methods (eg.OLS) can fail in high dimensional data where there can be more variables than observations.]

- .large[Geometric objects, like covariance matrices, fail to recognise the topological relationships that characterise networks]

- .large[FML offer numerical power and functional flexibility needed to identify complex patterns in high-dimensional space.]
---
class:inverse,middle
### Interaction effects all the way down
.large[
- High-dimensional datasets with many features (predictors) may have complex patterns.
- For `\(p\)` features there may be up to `\(2^p-p-1\)` interaction effects.
- Unlike ML algorithms, econometric models do not *learn* the structure of the data.
- In classical linear regression the model specification may easily miss some interactions, whereas, an ML algorithm, such as a decision tree, will recursively partition a dataset into subsets with simple patterns, which can be fit independently with simple linear specifications.

# Empirically Driven Asset Pricing

# Artificial intellience
 - We are now in the era of narrow AI.
 - AI experts' predictions vary as to when we can see *artificial general intelligence* (AGI)
--

## Machine Learning(ML)
 - This is generally thought of as a branch of AI
 - Traditional machine learning algorithms are designed for cross-sectional data sets.
 - Many financial problems require explicit modeling of complex time series properties.

--
 
### Deep learning
 - Is a branch of ML which has been the media darling of AI industry expansion
 - At its core it is using neural networks; algorithms inspired by the structure of the human brain.
 - Statisticians are less impressed, and prefer to categorise these models as semi-parametric to non-parametric.

# Statistical Modeling Vs Machine Learning
- Supervised machine learning is often an algorithmic form of statistical model estimation in which the data generation process is treated as an unknown (Breiman 2001). 

- Model selection and inference is automated, with an emphasis on processing large amounts of data to develop robust models. 

- It can be viewed as a highly efficient data compression technique designed to provide predictors in complex settings where relations between input and output variables are non-linear and input space is often high-dimensional. 

- Machine learners balance filtering data with the goal of making accurate and robust decisions, often discrete and as a categorical function of input data. 

---
name: statistics1
class: middle, inverse

# Statistical Modeling Vs Machine Learning
- This fundamentally differs from maximum likelihood estimators used in standard statistical models, which assume that the data was generated by the model and typically have difficulty with over-fitting, especially when applied to high-dimensional datasets. 

- Given the complexity of modern datasets, whether they are limit order books or high-dimensional financial time series, it is increasingly questionable whether we can posit inference on the basis of a known data generation process.

- It is a reasonable assertion, even if an economic interpretation of the data generation process can be given, that the exact form cannot be known all the time. 

- The paradigm that machine learning provides for data analysis therefore is very different from the traditional statistical modeling and testing framework. 
- Traditional fit metrics, such as `\(R^2\)`, t-values, p-values, and the notion of statistical significance, are replaced by out-of-sample forecasting and understanding the bias–variance tradeoff. 

- Machine learning is data-driven and focuses on finding structure in large datasets. 

- The main tools for variable or predictor selection are regularization and dropout.

# Modeling paradigms
### Parametric models
- Parametric assume finite set of parameters and model the response as a function of the input variables and the parameters.
- They potentially easier to interpret but have limited flexibility, especially in big data with complex patterns.

- .bg-hot-pink.b--dark-pink.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[Examples: OLS regression, neural networks, hidden Markov models, etc]
### Non-parametric models
- They treat the parameter space as infinite dimensional; i.e. they introduce a hidden or latent function.
- They grow in complexity with more data.

-  .bg-hot-pink.b--dark-pink.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[Examples: kernel methods, support vector machines, Gaussian processes]

class: middle
# Modeling paradigms
- Models can also be distinguished into .bg-hot-pink[probabilistic] and .bg-hot-pink[deterministic].

- In finance, a particular niche of probabilistic models is occupied by *state-space models*.

- They assume the existences of a **latent (unobserved)** process, whose **evolution** drives a certain observable process.

- The evolution of the latent process and the dependence of the observable process on the latent process are usually given in stochastic, or probabilistic terms.

- Confusingly, deterministic models may produce probabilistic outputs, for example a logistic regression gives the probability that the response is positive given the input variables.

- The choice between probabilistic and deterministic falls under the general and more devisive topic of :

# Training set overfitting

## Problem

- Training set overfitting results from choosing a specification that is so flexible that it explains not only the signal, but also the noise.
- The results will be a model which is *overconfident* in predicting *incorrectly*

--
## Solutions

1. Evaluate the **generalisation error**, through resampling techniques and Monte carlo methods
2. **Regularisation methods** to prevent model complexity unless it is justified in terms of greater explanatory power. 
  - For example LASSO techniques to reduce parameters or early stopping to restrict the model's structure
3. **Ensemble techniques** to reduce the variance of the error by combining the forecasts of a collection of estimators.

---
class: middle

# Test set overfitting

.large[
- A standard approach in industry is to use historical data to **backtest** an investment strategy identified from the training set

- Researchers who run multiple statistical tests on the same data set are more likely to make a false discovery.

- This selection bias comes from fitting the model to perform well on the test set, not the train set.

- **Test set overfitting** occurs when a researcher backtests a strategy until the output achieves a desired performance.

- The poor performance of a backtest should be a sign to fix the research process, not the investment strategy.
]

---
class:middle

# Solutions to test set overfitting

1. Use the familywise error rate (FWER) or the Deflated Sharpe ratio. 
  
  - FWER evaluates the probability of at least one of the outcomes of a number of independent backtests is a false positive. The Deflated Sharpe ratio is a statistics that controls for the FWER.

2. Use combinatorial purged cross-validation methods (CPCV), which generate many test sets using resampling combinatorial splits of train and test sets.

3. Use historical series to estimate the underlying data-generating process, and use **Monte Carlo methods** to create *fake*/synthetic samples that match the statistical properties observed in history
